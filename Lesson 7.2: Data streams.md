# 7.2: Data streams

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how data streams provide an additional layer of abstraction to simplify and separate time-series data coming from many data sources.

In this lab, you will learn about data streams by performing the following tasks:

    Clone an index template and add a data stream
    Update a component template to add a data stream field
    Roll over the data stream and index a document into the data stream
    View the mappings for the backing indices
    Add an integration to automatically create a data stream
