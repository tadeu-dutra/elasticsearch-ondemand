# 3.1. Full Text Queries

In this lesson, you will learn how to search using full text queries. You will also learn how a score is calculated for each document that is a hit and by default, the ‘hits’ in the query response are sorted by this score.


# Review

- The way the multi_match query is executed depends on the type parameter. For example, setting “type”: “phrase” runs a match_phrase. The type parameter specifies what type of query is executed for multi_match.
- Search results are sorted by score by default, but you can change the sort order with the sort parameter.
- 10 is the default number of hits returned from a query using the Query DSL. You can change this using the size parameter.
