# 5.3: Runtime Fields

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create and use runtime fields using Elasticsearch’s scripting language: Painless.




# Review

- Instead of hard-coding values, use named params to make scripts flexible, and also reduce compilation time when the script runs.
- You can add fields to existing documents without reindexing your data.
- You can directly define a runtime mapping at query time. You don't need to define runtime fields in advance.
