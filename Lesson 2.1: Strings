# Lesson 2.1: Strings

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how Elasticsearch handles strings in your documents and how text is analyzed using an analyzer. You will also learn the differences between two data types: Strings vs Keywords.

# Review

- By default, text strings are analyzed by Elasticsearch at query time.
- Unlike text strings, keywords are not analyzed.
- The standard analyzer is the default analyzer which is used if no other analyzer is specified.
